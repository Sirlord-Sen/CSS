        <h1>Text Styling</h1>
        <p>Every believer was created by God to succeed. No particular person was created for success. In the first book of the bible, we learn that the first mandate God gave to man was for man to be successful.</p>
        
        <h2>A Blockquote</h2>
        <blockquote>That is how serious names can be. Names have a great effect on us. You are your name! This even goes for our Lord Jesus Christ as His name means Savior. So, we realize that in the Hebrew language, the life of an object is in its name. In other words, the life of an object is its name!</blockquote>
