                <p>It is important to note that God didn’t create the human soul. The soul was created as a result of the spirit (God’s breath) meeting the body. Since it is not directly created by God, then it doesn’t have a purpose on its own. It rather takes the form or the desires of another entity. It is the link between the spirit and the body. It is the entity that keeps the spirit in the body of a human.</p>

                <p> When the soul leaves the body, the spirit is detached from the body immediately. So the spirit needs the soul to survive! God’s purpose for our lives dwells within His breath (the spirit) but God needed a physical being to be able to fulfill that purpose. So God’s plan to fulfill His purpose is by making the spirit feed the body with His purpose and convince the body to fulfill His purpose. However, the spirit does not have a direct link to the body. It is rather connected to the body through the soul. Therefore, if only the soul could be transformed into the image of the spirit, then the body can now fulfill God’s purpose!</p>
